/*Car and Bus are different types of vehicles. Car has its private property speed and passenger. The Bus also
has the same property. Both the vehicleâ€™s speed depends on its engine and passenger depends on number of
sits given when a Car of a Bus is created.
You are assigned to the task of comparing the two types of vehicles by their speed.
Now translate the scenario to a C++ program, by creating the classes and comparing the speed of two objects
of the classes Bus and Car.*/
